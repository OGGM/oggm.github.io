OGGM joined Twitter in 2018, a couple of years after the project was created.
Over the years, we made many connections there and reached audiences beyond the usual scientific bubble.

Twitter has since become X, and OGGM stopped posting in 2023. The account will be deleted soon.

The tweets below form a static archive of that period. A small record of a time when the platform played a positive role in scientific exchange.
