The workshop is the 9<sup>th</sup> in a series that has brought together the community of users and developers of the Open Global Glacier Model ([OGGM](https://oggm.org/)).

**This year, the workshop will be shorter and OGGM-focused over 3 days**, as always in an informal and friendly atmosphere.

The workshop welcomes active or soon-to-be-active large-scale glacier modellers, in particular users and developers of OGGM. Its primary objective is to address current challenges in
glacier modeling, foster mutual learning, and discuss ideas and visions for advancing glacier models and their governance. Attendees can expect a mix of scientific presentations and discussion/brainstorming sessions.
Unlike previous years, **no hands-on or beginner sessions are planned**.

### Topics

- modelling of glaciers at large scales (mountain range to global scale)
- glacier change projections and impacts of glacier change (hydrology, hazards, sea-level rise)
- data assimilation and ice thickness inversion
- paleo-simulations and glacier reconstructions
- model development, calibration, validation
- visualisation of glacier model results
- future of OGGM: perspectives, governance, sustainability

### Agenda

We aim to maintain a flexible schedule that adapts to the participants' needs, interests, and suggestions. Typically, the first afternoon will be reserved for presentations,
the second day dedicated to group discussions, and the last morning to the future of OGGM. All sessions will happen with all participants (no parallel sessions).

1. <b>Scientific presentations</b>: Participant presentations (approx. 5–20 minutes) on topics relevant to the workshop.
2. <b>Discussion/brainstorming sessions</b>: Covering all aspects of OGGM and global glacier modeling.
3. <b>Future session</b>: Addressing long-term needs and societal relevance of glacier modelling, especially in the context of OGGM.

### Who can participate?

The workshop is open to anyone involved in glaciological modelling. Please note that participant numbers are limited to around 15–20 due to accommodation and
logistical constraints.

### Location

The workshop will be held at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium)](https://www.vub.be/en). The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)
is a Dutch- and English-speaking research university in Brussels, Belgium, formed in 1970. The university covers a broad range of disciplines,
including natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, humanities, and engineering. It provides bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral education to about 8,000 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students.

### Transportation

VUB is easily accessible by public transport from Brussels' main train stations or the airport.

### Arrival / departure dates

The workshop starts at VUB on **October 6, 2025** in the early afternoon and ends on **October 8, 2025** before lunch. This should give participants time to arrive on Monday morning and leave on Wednesday afternoon.

### Accommodation / meals and workshop fee

There is **no workshop fee**, but the organisers do not cover accommodation, travel, or meals. Each participant is responsible for their own expenses. We will explore options for staying on campus and update you with any available possibilities.

### Registration procedure

If you are interested in participating, please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-SUH4Ysy-bSah7qX82Udp-dscLU9vaFnRChtjHOGM7E2weA/viewform?usp=header)
by **June 15<sup>th</sup>**. Please note that participation is limited to 15–20 people. If we receive more applications than available spots, a selection process will be carried out based on responses in the form.
Selected participants will be notified by early July. For any questions, feel free to contact us at info@oggm.org.
