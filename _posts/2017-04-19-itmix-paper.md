The paper summarizing the ITMIX experiment is now
[published](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/949/2017/tc-11-949-2017.html)!

This paper will surely become a standard for anyone interested in glacier
ice thickness inversion methods. The OGGM model is ranked amongst the best
approaches able to deal with large numbers of glaciers.

Thanks to Daniel Farinotti for coordinating this great effort!
