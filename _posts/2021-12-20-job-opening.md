As a mid-size university with 270 professorships and 20.000 students, the University of Bremen maintains a strong and internationally renowned interdisciplinary research focus on oceans and the global climate. The Institute of Geography invites applications for the following position, starting March 1st, 2022 (or as soon as possible thereafter), for the duration of 24 months:

**Postdoctoral Researcher** <br>
salary grade E 13 TV-L <br>
full time position <br>
**Reference number: A299/21** <br>

The successful candidate will work in the project "A future-ready Open Global Glacier Model
(OGGM)", funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). This project seeks to further develop 
the [Open Global Glacier Model](http://oggm.org), a state-of-the art, open-source, 
flexible large-scale glacier modelling framework written in Python. OGGM is used by 
several research groups worldwide to compute large scale past and future glacier 
changes as well as associated impacts.

We seek to improve and develop the model in the following areas:
- uncertainty quantification (ensemble or Bayesian approaches, global sensitivity analysis, etc.)
- code sustainability (testing, continuous integration, documentation) and flexibility (interfaces for new parameterizations, reduction of the technical debt)
- [<u>documentation</u>](https://docs.oggm.org), [<u>tutorials</u>](https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable), education, and outreach (e.g. [<u>OGGM-Edu</u>](https://edu.oggm.org))

Depending on the profile of the candidate, we are also keen to further develop OGGM in the following areas:
- implementation of new physical processes
- numerics (performance, implementation of higher order ice dynamics models)
- statistics and machine learning

The postdoc will focus on one (or more) of the topics listed above. We are looking for 
someone highly motivated by glacier modelling and geoscientific software development. 
We are fully open to innovative ideas and to flexible work arrangements and we are 
happy to adapt the content of the work assignment to your profile and qualifications, 
as well as to your future career goals. The minimum requirement is that these 
developments are useful for our growing community of users and are made freely 
available. If suitable, the results of these developments should be published 
in peer-reviewed journals (GMD, JAMES, etc.).

Close collaboration is expected with the active community of OGGM users and with the 
two main groups currently working on the development of OGGM at the University of 
Innsbruck and the University of Bremen. While your affiliation will be with the 
University of Bremen, you will be invited (but not required) to spend substantial 
time in Innsbruck, as well as to organize online or in-person workshops in 
selected countries of the Global South, and at large international conferences. 
Depending on interest, you will also be involved in shaping the long-term goals 
of the project (for example by writing follow-up research proposals).

To apply successfully, you will:
- have a PhD in a field of earth or computational science
- have demonstrated skill in scientific programming (Python highly favored)
- be fluent in English (equivalent to CEFR level C1)

It will be advantageous if you can demonstrate:
- experience in the field of glacier, hydrological, or climate modelling
- a record of collaborative open-source software development (github or gitlab profile), in particular in the scientific python stack (Jupyter, Pangeo, etc.)
- experience with software testing practices (continuous integration)
- that you will bring innovative ideas to the OGGM project and its ecosystem

Questions regarding the position should be addressed to [Ben Marzeion](mailto:ben.marzeion@uni-bremen.de) and [Fabien Maussion](mailto:fabien.maussion@uibk.ac.at). The funded project proposal (slightly
outdated today, but still relevant) is available [here](https://oggm.org/img/blog/software_project/dfg_software_proposal_final.pdf) as a PDF.

The University of Bremen is an equal opportunity employer and aims particularly at increasing the share of female faculty members in research and teaching. Thus, qualified women are especially encouraged to apply. International applications and those from candidates with a migration background are explicitly appreciated. Candidates with disabilities will be given preference in case of equal qualifications.

**Please submit your application including the reference number A299/21, a
letter of motivation, CV (with copies of certificates), and contact
details of two referees until January 14th, 2022 to**:
