We are happy to announce the very first **OGGM online tutorial**!

**When?** [Thursday April 16 14:00 CEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=OGGM+online+tutorial&iso=20200416T14&p1=1889&ah=2)

**Where?** Via [Zoom](http://zoom.us). Please [drop me an email](https://fabienmaussion.info/) to ask for the meeting's url.

**What?** Tentative agenda:
- model structure and workflow: glacier directories, tasks, and what motivated these design choices
- model physics: pre-processing, mass-balance and glacier evolution
- typical pitfalls: what to expect if you plan to use the model yourself
- model installation, testing, and updates: how to make sure that everything works as expected
- any other topic you'd like to talk about

This tutorial will be a gentle introduction to the model!
I expect the meeting to last for about two hours. There will be plenty of time
for questions. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to have tried the
[online tutorials](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/oggm_tuto.html) beforehand.

 We are looking forward to meet you there!
