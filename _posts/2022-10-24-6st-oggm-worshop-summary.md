Almost a year after the [5th OGGM workshop in Neuharlingersiel](https://oggm.org/2021/10/12/5th-oggm-worshop-summary/), 
it was time for the next chapter, in a series that has brought together the community of users, developers and friends 
of OGGM. After what was for most of us a long day of traveling and a beautiful train 
journey, we arrived in Finse, a remote village between Bergen and Oslo, that can only be reached by train. All that 
was remaining of our journey was a 20 minute walk to the [research station](www.finse.uio.no) through the alpine tundra 
with some of the outlet glaciers of the near by ice cap insight, before receiving a warm welcome by the station manager, 
the cooks and the workshop participants that arrived a little earlier. This year’s workshop was jointly organized with 
the Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) community and for the first time the workshop did not solely focus on OGGM. 
PyGEM, ODINN, COSIPY and GloGEM were also present, leading to a wider range of topics being presented and some more 
overarching discussions compared to the previous editions. 

The program consisted of presentations, mostly in the mornings, by the participants that were grouped together in 
the thematic sessions: "<i>Recent developments in global glacier modeling</i>", “<i>Glacier-related hydrology and data</i>” 
and “<i>Glacier evolution, past and future, ensemble studies and intercomparison</i>”. The presentations ranged from 
longer overview presentations, to presentations of latest results, short pitches of new ideas and two posters. This mix 
of different presentation lenghts, was a result of giving all participants the option to indicate if, what, in what 
format and how long they would like to present. The thematic sessions were based on the submissions, instead of 
being defined priorly. Personally really enjoyed how that worked out, both because it created some variety in the 
presentation types and because oneself can often best estimate what would be good to present to the audience. 
During the afternoons there were hands-on tutorials in PyGEM and OGGM for beginners, OGGM for more advanced users 
and discussion sessions. The full program you can find in the following 
[document](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm.github.io/tree/master/img/blog/6st_workshop/Workshop_Program_2022.pdf). 
Having said that, the program wasn't rigid. Intresting discussions and questions were for instance prioritized above 
sticking to the schedule.

The excursion to the nearby glacier was for some of us the first time a seeing a glacier up close, making it a wonderful 
experience setting foot on one, especially considering that all of us are doing glacier research. For one of us it was a
more like a dream coming true that had involved months of commited preperation, but also to those with plenty of 
experience in the field, visiting a glacier keeps being amazing. The hike to the glacier was also a good opportunity 
to mingle and socialize, and so was the icebreaker, a ice and climate pub quiz where the more senior scientists were 
the mascots of their teams. Living for some days together in one place was great for getting to know each other a 
little better and formed I think a nice basis for exchanging knowledge and further collaborations. 

I’m already looking forward to the next edition :)
