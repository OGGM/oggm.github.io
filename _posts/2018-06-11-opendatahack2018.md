OGGM participated to a [hackathon event](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/79/overview)
organized by the ECMWF in Reading. The hackathon tool place in the context
of the #OpenDataHack2018 week, and the rules were quite simple: chose a
programming challenge realizable in one day, form a team
and hack during 24 hours under the motto "Innovate with Open Climate Data".

I was there and came with a challenge idea:
[Open climate data seen by mountain glaciers as a natural low-pass filter](https://github.com/OpenDataHack2018/OpenDataHack2018-Challenges/issues/9).
I was lucky to be joined by a new friend [Patrick](https://github.com/PaleTomato)
from the UK Met Office, who was of great help (both programmatically and
psychologically ;).

## The outcome

After 24 hours of programming and little sleep, we came up with three online
visualizations (I learned they're called "dashboards") which you can try out here:
[https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/](https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/).

They are written using OGGM and [dash+plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/).
I highly recommend both tools, they are great!
It turns out the jury liked our apps too! We've been rewarded with a price in the
category HackVis (visualizations).

The judges used 5 criteria to score the team projects:
Originality and creativity, Technical innovation, Use of data and services,
Impact and usefulness, Impressiveness ("Wow" factor). I am very proud we were
selected, but I must say that [many other projects](https://github.com/OpenDataHack2018org)
deserved it as much as we did.

The white boxes in our hands are "Virtual Reality Headsets",
which is something I didn't know I needed but I now have one.

## What did we do exactly?

Here are some info about the small apps we programmed. Code and data at the
time of writing are available on [this repository](https://github.com/OGGM/OpenDataHack2018-Glaciers).
For the runs I used a slightly modified version of OGGM available on
[this branch](https://github.com/fmaussion/oggm/tree/hackathon).

### App 1: World glacier explorer

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">World <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Glacier?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Glacier</a> Explorer developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/OGGM1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OGGM1</a> using ERA-Interim data  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenDataHack2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OpenDataHack2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/BU4xdFB48P">pic.twitter.com/BU4xdFB48P</a></p>&mdash; Mark Parrington (@m_parrington) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_parrington/status/1005826611642535936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the [first app](https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/explore), we used data
compiled from our [GMD paper](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-9/)
about glacier locations, altitude and their climate. The application allows to
select ranges of data in each single plot, actualizing the other plots
instantly. It permits to gain more insight about the data and ask questions like:
where are the warmest glaciers located? The wettest? What is the relationship
between latitude and climate? etc.

In order to make the app more responsive I had to aggregate the data into 1° bins
before display, which limits the number of analyses
one can do. Some of the things I'd really like to see implemented soon:
- use bins of 0.3° instead (or even less?)
- rely on the higher resolution ERA5 data for climate information
- add Antarctic glaciers
- add other climate variables (seasonality, humidity, radiation?)
- add other glacier statistic (land/water terminating, glacier/ice caps, etc)

### App 2: Climate change scenarios

In the [second app](https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/scenarios) (written
by Patrick), we propose to explore the impact of various warming scenarios on
all alpine glaciers larger than 5 km<sup>2</sup>. Users can select amongst
7 variables (length, area, volume, temperature, precipitation, solid precipitation,
equilibrium line altitude) and plot them under a number of scenarios. When
hovering with the mouse over a glacier, the plots should appear.

The data is generated artificially: we shuffled years from the last 31 years
randomly and added a temperature bias (the "0.8°C warming" scenario is
without any temperature bias, i.e. the untouched climate of 1985-2015).  

I really like this app because people can choose their "favorite glacier" and
see what is projected to happen. It clearly links climate to length and area
changes, illustrating the "low-pass filter" role of glaciers. My original plan
was to use real CMIP data for this app, but these data are nor yet available
from the climate data store.

Some of the things I'd really like to see implemented soon:
- use real GCM data instead of the fake one
- one app per RGI region?
- more ways to select glaciers
- possibility to visualize both climate and glacier changes in the same view


### App 3: Geometry changes

In the [third app](https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/geometry), a time slider
allows to directly see the length and thickness changes of glaciers in the
Öztaler Alps. The data is taken from the OGGM
[documentation script](http://oggm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_examples/run_rgi_region.html)
run for a "commitment experiment" (what happens if the climate doesn't change anymore)
and for a period of 100 years.

This app definitely needs more tuning (and wasn't even shown during the hackathon
presentation):
- it should be smoother and faster (I don't know yet how to do this)
- we need a way to represent the glacier widths, too
- different scenarios should be drawn on the same plot

## Conclusions

First of all, I would like to thank my coding partner Patrick for his help,
and [Timo](https://github.com/TimoRoth) (University of Bremen) for his invaluable
help with the dash server. Big thanks also to the organizers, this
was a very good first experience for me.

Here are a few points I've taken home with me:
- coding for 24 hours is much better than you'd imagine, and it definitely gets
  things done!
- Dash and plotly are great tools, let's do more of those!
- The [<u>Copernicus Data Store</u>](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) is cool, but
  not yet ready for prime time. Let's hope it's going to get better!
