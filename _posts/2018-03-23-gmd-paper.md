**The first OGGM paper is finally out for review!**

It took us quite some time (writing a model is *hard*), but it's finally
there: soberly entitled "The Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) v1.0", the
manuscript is in open review for Geoscientific Model Development.

[Check it out](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-9/) and send
