Two publications making use of the OGGM model came out recently:

- Khadka, M., Kayastha, R. B. and Kayastha, R.: **Future projection of cryospheric and hydrologic regimes in Koshi River basin, Central Himalaya, using coupled glacier dynamics and glacio-hydrological models**, J. Glaciol., 1–15, [doi:10.1017/jog.2020.51](https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2020.51), 2020.
- Parkes, D. and Goosse, H.: **Modelling regional glacier length changes over the last millennium using the Open Global Glacier Model**, The Cryosphere, 14, 3135–3153, [doi:10.5194/tc-14-3135-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3135-2020), 2020.

What makes these publications very special to us is that, for the first time that we are aware of, the authors of these publications were able to use and apply the OGGM model *without any involvement of the OGGM core team*, and without any technical support from us. 

**This is a big step for OGGM, and a fantastic reward for all the work that went into documenting and making OGGM useful and user friendly**.

We still have a lot of work to do to make the model even *more* user friendly of course, but we are proud of what we achieved. We are also seeking funding to make the OGGM codebase even better and cleaner, but it turns out to be quite difficult using traditional funding schemes. If you are aware of software oriented research funds that we could apply for, let us know!
