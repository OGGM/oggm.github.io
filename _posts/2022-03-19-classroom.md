After a few months of test, we are happy to announce the launch of [classroom.oggm.org](https://classroom.oggm.org),
a JupyterHub server designed to help teachers use OGGM in their classes.

### What is it?

For those of you unfamiliar with Jupyter: [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is an online server allowing multiple users to connect 
to a single machine preconfigured for a given purpose (mostly: running Jupyter Notebooks).

[classroom.oggm.org](https://classroom.oggm.org) is a JupyterHub server running on a machine located in Bremen (Germany), with OGGM and OGGM-Edu pre-installed.
Teachers (and their students) can ask for an account and will be given 10Gb disk space each, as well as a few resources (up to 2G RAM and 2 CPUs). This should be more than enough to run the [OGGM-Edu notebooks](https://oggm.org/oggm-edu-notebooks) experiments!

### Who can use it?

We should have enough resources to give every interested teacher an account to try it out. Just [get in touch](mailto:info@oggm.org) and tell us who you are and why you want to use the classroom. The server should be strong enough to accommodate for a class of about 16 students login in at the same time, probably a little bit more (needs testing). Therefore, **we should be able to host a few classes per semester**, as long as they aren't all happening at the same time! Where possible, we would like to prioritize classes from less favored backgrounds; but please get in touch and we'll do our best! We can't guarantee you a spot, but we may provide some support to help you set-up a hub on your university premises. 

**Have fun with OGGM-Edu!**
