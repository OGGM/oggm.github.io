**Due to the situation, the workshop is POSTPONED! Visit [this link]({{site.base_url}}/2020/05/12/5th-workshop-postponed/) for the new announcement.**

The 5th OGGM workshop will take place from June 8th to 12th in Neuharlingersiel, Germany.

### What is it ?

The OGGM workshop is an annual, informal meeting for developers, users, and future users
of the [OGGM](http://docs.oggm.org) model. The workshop is open to any interested scientist
(within the limits of our capacities!).

### Save the date

**Monday 8th to Friday 12th of June 2020**. Monday to Wednesday the focus will be on presentations of previous and
ongoing work, Thursday to Friday will focus on trainings and coding sessions (hands-on).
We will start in the late afternoon on Monday, and finish before noon on Friday.

### Location

The workshop will be held at the DJH (youth hostel with very good standard) Neuharlingersiel
([www.djh-resort.de](https://www.djh-resort.de)),
very close to the North Sea coast. The hostel provides all facilities for our workshop (incl. catering).
The location is best reached by train to Norden, from where we will offer a shuttle. More information on
logistics will be provided to registered participants later.

### Agenda

This tentative schedule is for orientation only. We would like this workshop to be as flexible as possible and will
adjust to the needs and suggestions of the participants! **The first part of the workshop (08th to 10th of June)**
has two main objectives:

1. **State and applications of OGGM** : the first sessions will deal with presentations from the participants about
the state, recent developments and results of OGGM, and its place in the international context of glacier modeling.

2. **Future developments and visions for OGGM** : the second session will be dedicated to specific discussions and
more general brainstorming about the future and goals of the OGGM project.

**For the hands-on sessions in the following two days**, we will split the participants into smaller groups:

- **Beginner tutorials**: these sessions are for current and future OGGM users to get to know the model internals
  and learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
- **Code sprints**: we will address specific coding challenges
  together, in the form of a [programming sprint](https://oggm.org/2018/10/16/hack-day/).
- **Q&A**: we will leave time open to discuss actual problems in the model itself,
  and try to develop strategies to solve them.

This second part is targeting current and future model *users*, or
people interested in the model internals. It will be rather technical.

### Who can participate ?

Anyone interested in the model, or in glaciological modeling in general! In particular, we would like to
encourage potential users and developers to join us, to get to know each other, and to gather first-hand
information about the model internals.
Note that in case of high interest we might have to limit the number of participants.

### Workshop fee

**The fee for participation for the entire workshop is â‚¬ 490**, and includes the costs for the workshop, room (four nights),
and full board from the afternoon of June 8th to the morning of June 12.
