This year has been eventful for our community. As the year draws to a close, we're excited to summarize the advancements in our models, share some of this year's highlights, and provide an outlook for 2024.

### Code, Data, and Standard Projections

- The OGGM 1.6 release brought significant improvements, including a [<u>new calibration scheme</u>](https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable/notebooks/advanced/massbalance_calibration.html) for the mass balance model, a semi-implicit solver for glacier dynamics, and an option to [<u>dynamically calibrate the model</u>](https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable/notebooks/10minutes/dynamical_spinup.html). These features are now used in the default setup and have been instrumental in generating [<u>pre-processed directories</u>](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/shop.html#pre-processed-directories) for initializing OGGM.
- [<u>An additional option in the pre-processed directories</u>](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/shop.html#additional-available-data) includes ITS-LIVE and other data processed on the same grid as OGGM.
- The latest release introduced [<u>OGGM standard projections</u>](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/download-projections.html), with simulations driven by CMIP5, CMIP6, and ISIMIP3b_CMIP6, extending up to 2100 CE or 2300 CE. We plan to update these projections with each substantial model release.
- OGGM is now compatible with the latest RGI version (RGI 7.0). However, the global data needed for calibration (mostly: geodetic mass balance) is not yet available. We anticipate its availability in 2024!

### Events
- In collaboration with the Himalayan University Consortium (HUC) and the Centre for Water Informatics & Technology, we hosted a [<u>1-week glacier modeling training</u>](https://oggm.org/2023/10/27/Lahore-video/) last spring at LUMS in Lahore, Pakistan.
- The 7<sup>th</sup> [<u>OGGM workshop in Edinburgh</u>](https://oggm.org/2023/09/07/7th-oggm-worshop-summary/) was a success. Thanks to Beatriz and Dan for hosting!
- An online OGGM Governance workshop is scheduled for January 29<sup>th</sup>, focusing on preparing the OGGM organisation for future challenges.
- The next OGGM workshop, a joint event with IGM, will be held from August 26-30 in Switzerland. Stay tuned for more details in 2024!

### Community News
- Congratulations to Rodrigo, Jan, and Larissa on successfully defending their PhDs!
- Fabien has relocated from Innsbruck to Bristol.
- Over [<u>14 papers</u>](https://oggm.org/publications/) making substantial use of OGGM were published this year.
- Our community has grown significantly over the past year. While we bid farewell to Hamid, Julia, Jan, and Larissa, we also warmly welcome back Beatriz!

### A Final Word
A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to OGGM, whether through code, documentation, discussions, support, or other means. OGGM thrives because of your diverse contributions. Recognizing these efforts is important to us, and finding better ways to acknowledge them is our resolution for the new year.

Happy Holidays and best wishes for a prosperous OGGM year 2024!
