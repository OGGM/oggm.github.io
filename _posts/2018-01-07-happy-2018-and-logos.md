**The OGGM team wishes you a successful and happy 2018!**

Many exciting things are going to happen this year with the imminent submission of our
first OGGM paper to [Geoscientific Model Development](https://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/)
(more on this soon!), the [2018 OGGM workshop](http://oggm.org/2017/12/17/3rd-workshop-announcement/)
which is the first to be opened to external participants, the start of a new
project based on OGGM lead by Hugues Goosse at the [UC Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/node/40969),
and much more!

You might have noticed that the OGGM website had its "Santa costume" put on for the
last couple of weeks. If you missed it, here is a screenshot:

Aren't they sweet? This brings me to the second topic of this post:

### OGGM logos

If you want to use our logos for your posters, presentations, papers, you
are welcome to do so! We have several version of them, here are the download links:
