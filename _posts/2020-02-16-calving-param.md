I always thought that it would be very hard to get the

parameterization in OGGM's flowline model. As it turns out, getting *something* to work was not so hard after all.
This is very much a work in progress, but it should
get the ball rolling for more advanced treatment of frontal ablation
with OGGM in the future (stay tuned!).

The new feature is documented in a Jupyter Notebook. You can read it rendered

or you can run the notebook yourself on [OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/oggm_tuto.html).

Many thanks to David Rounce who persevered in convincing me that it shouldn't be
"that hard to implement", and Lizz Ultee for her expertise and advice.
