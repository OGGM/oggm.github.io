I long thought that it would be very hard to get the
[Oerlemans & Nick (2005)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/minimal-model-of-a-tidewater-glacier/C6B72F547D8C44CDAAAD337E1F2FC97F)
parameterization in OGGM's flowline model.
This is very much a work in progress, but should
get the ball rolling for more advanced treatment of frontal ablation
in OGGM in the future (stay tuned!).

The new feature is documented in a Jupyter Notebook. You can read it rendered

or run the notebook yourself on [OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/oggm_tuto.html)'s
tutorials.

Many thanks to David Rounce who persevered in convincing me that it shouldn't be
"that hard to implement", and Lizz Ultee for her expertise and advice.
