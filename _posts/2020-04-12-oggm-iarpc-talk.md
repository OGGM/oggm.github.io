I gave a presentation about OGGM at the [IARPC Glaciers and Sea Level
Collaboration Team Meeting](https://www.iarpccollaborations.org/members/documents/16600)
on the topic of **Modelling ALL the glaciers: Global glacier modeling**.

The slides are available [here](https://oggm.org/framework_talk/). The
presentations (the first one by Regine Hock) have been recorded, so that
you can hear me talking a bit too fast. Enjoy!
