As a mid-size university with 270 professorships and 20.000 students, the University of Bremen maintains a strong and internationally renowned interdisciplinary research focus on oceans and the global climate.  
The Institute of Geography, University of Bremen, invites applications for the following academic position (under the condition of job release), starting September 1, 2020, for the duration of three years:

Postdoctoral Researcher (f/m/d)  
salary grade EG 13 TV-L  
full time position  
Reference number: A131/20

The postdoc will work in the [Climate Lab of the Institute of Geography](http://www.geographie.uni-bremen.de/en/climate-geography).  
This postdoctoral position is funded by the European Commission through the PROTECT H2020 project (Sept. 2020 - Aug. 2024, duration of the postdoc: Sept. 2020 to Aug. 2023). PROTECT gathers 26 international partners and aims to project the glaciers’ and ice sheets’ contributions to sea-level rise, and to assess local implications. More details on PROTECT can be found [here](https://protect-sealevelrise.osug.fr/).  
In our work package we will - jointly with partners at the ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich - improve projections of the glaciers' contribution to global sea level. The postdoc to be employed at the University of Bremen will develop and implement a parameterization of the effects of debris cover on glacier mass change on the global scale. The performance of the parameterization will be evaluated using the global glacier models GloGEM and OGGM, using calibration and cross-validation tools based on large-scale observations of glaciers from remote sensing.

The postdoc will also contribute to the coordination of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project, in order to advance large-ensemble projections of the glaciers’ contribution to sea-level rise during the 21st century.

To apply successfully, you will:
- have a PhD in a field of Earth science, physics, or mathematics with a background in numerical modeling of glaciers;
- have experience with advanced glacier model evaluation methods and/or effects of debris cover on mass balance;
- be a proficient user of Python for scientific computing;
- have a publication record in peer-reviewed, international journals;
- be fluent in English (equivalent to CEFR level C1).

It will be advantageous if you can demonstrate experience in:
- collaborating in large, international research collaborations;
- applying for competitive, external funding;
- working in a supercomputing environment.

Proficiency in German is not necessary, but may be helpful for everyday life in Bremen.
The University of Bremen is an equal opportunity employer and aims particularly at increasing the share of female scientists employed in research and teaching. Thus, qualified women are especially encouraged to apply. International applications and those from candidates with a migration background are explicitly appreciated. Candidates with disabilities will be given preference in case of equal qualifications.

Questions regarding the position should be addressed to Ben Marzeion (_ben.marzeion [at] uni-bremen.de_).

Please submit your application including the reference number, a letter of motivation, CV (with copies of certificates), and contact details of two referees until June 24, 2020 to:

Universität Bremen  
Fachbereich 8  
FB8/3 – Reference number A131/20  
Universitäts-Boulevard 13  
28359 Bremen  

or by E-Mail to: _fb08.bewerbung [at] uni-bremen.de_

All applications received before June 24, 2020 will be considered, thereafter review will continue until the position is filled.
