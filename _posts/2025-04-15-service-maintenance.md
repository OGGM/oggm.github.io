**A scheduled maintenance will require a shutdown of the OGGM cluster from the evening of April 27 to the morning of April 30 (CEST).**

The OGGM websites—including the documentation, OGGM-Edu, and tutorials—will remain operational. However, the OGGM cluster will be unavailable during this period. This means:

- OGGM will not be able to download data from the server
- The OGGM Hubs will not be able to access the OGGM cluster

This will not affect the OGGM code itself, but it will prevent you from running OGGM locally if your workflow depends on downloading data from the OGGM server.
