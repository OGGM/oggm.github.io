As a mid-size university with 270 professorships and 20.000 students,
the University of Bremen maintains a strong and internationally renowned
interdisciplinary research focus on oceans and the global climate. The
Institute of Geography invites applications for the following position,
starting October 1st, 2021 (or as soon as possible thereafter), for the
duration of 24 months:

**Postdoctoral Researcher / Research Software Engineer** <br>
salary grade E 13 TV-L <br>
full time position <br>
**Reference number: A136/21** <br>

The successful candidate will work in the project "A future-ready Open
Global Glacier Model (OGGM)", funded by the German Research Foundation
(DFG). This project seeks to improve the quality and usefulness of the
codebase of the [Open Global Glacier Model](http://oggm.org), a
state-of-the art, open-source, flexible large-scale glacier modelling
framework written in Python.

We seek to improve and develop the model in the following areas:
- code sustainability (testing, continuous integration, documentation)
  and flexibility (refactoring, reduction of the technical debt,
  interfaces for new parameterizations)
- uncertainty quantification (ensemble or Bayesian approaches, global
  sensitivity analysis, etc.)
- deployment on HPC and cloud based infrastructure (computational
  workflows, data ingestion protocols)
- [documentation](https://docs.oggm.org), [tutorials](https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable), education, and outreach (e.g.[OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org))

Depending on the profile of the candidate, we are also keen to further
develop OGGM in the following areas:
- implementation of new physical processes
- numerics (performance, implementation of higher order ice dynamics models)
- statistics and machine learning

The postdoc or research software engineer will focus on one (or more) of
the topics listed above. We are looking for someone highly motivated by
geoscientific software development. We are fully open to innovative
ideas and to flexible work arrangements, and we are happy to adapt the
content of the work assignment to your profile and qualifications. The
minimum requirement is that these developments are useful for our
growing community of users and are made freely available. If suitable,
the results of these developments should be published in peer-reviewed
journals (GMD, JAMES, etc).

Close collaboration is expected with the community of OGGM users and
with the two main groups currently working on the development of OGGM at
the University of Innsbruck and the University of Bremen. You will be
invited (but not required) to spend some time at both institutions, as
well as to organize online or in-person workshops in selected countries
of the Global South, and at large international conferences.

To apply successfully, you will:
- have a PhD in a field of earth or computational science, or a
  university degree in computer- or geosciences or engineering and 3+
  years of experience as a research software engineer (or equivalent)
- have demonstrated skill in scientific programming (Python highly favored)
- have experience with collaborative software development, standard
  version control tools (git) and software testing practices (continuous
  integration)
- be fluent in English (equivalent to CEFR level C1)

It will be advantageous if you can demonstrate:
- experience in the field of glacier or climate modelling
- working experience in a supercomputing or cloud environment and with
  container technologies (docker, singularity)
- a record of open-source software development (github or gitlab
  profile), in particular in the scientific python stack (Jupyter, Pangeo,
  etc.)
- that you will bring innovative ideas to the OGGM project and its ecosystem

Questions regarding the position should be addressed to [Ben Marzeion](mailto:ben.marzeion@uni-bremen.de) and [Fabien Maussion](mailto:fabien.maussion@uibk.ac.at). The funded project proposal (slightly
outdated today, but still relevant) is available [here](https://oggm.org/img/blog/software_project/dfg_software_proposal_final.pdf) as a PDF.

The University of Bremen is an equal opportunity employer and aims
particularly at increasing the share of female faculty members in
research and teaching. Thus, qualified women are especially encouraged
to apply. International applications and those from candidates with a
migration background are explicitly appreciated. Candidates with
disabilities will be given preference in case of equal qualifications.

**Please submit your application including the reference number A136/21, a
letter of motivation, CV (with copies of certificates), and contact
details of two referees until August 31st, 2021 to**:
