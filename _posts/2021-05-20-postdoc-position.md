As a mid-size university with 270 professorships and 20.000 students, the University of Bremen maintains a strong and internationally renowned interdisciplinary research focus on oceans and the global climate. The Institute of Geography invites applications for the following academic position (under the condition of job release), starting September 1, 2021 (or as soon as possible thereafter), ending June 30, 2023:

Postdoctoral Researcher
salary grade EG 13 TV-L
full time position
Reference number:  A65/21

The postdoc will work in the [Climate Lab of the Institute of Geography](http://www.geographie.uni-bremen.de/en/climate-geography), in the project "Ice-Ocean Interaction of Peripheral Greenland Glaciers", funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) within the collaborative project cluster GReenland ice sheet/OCEan Interaction (see https://groce.de/en/).

The postdoc (w/m/d) will focus on regional modelling of peripheral glaciers in north-eastern Greenland within the framework of the Open Global Glacier Model (see http://oggm.org), which will be forced by regional ocean and atmospheric data sets; they will implement a refreezing parameterization in the mass balance module of OGGM, and they will test the sensitivity of OGGM to different boundary conditions. Finally, they will produce projections of freshwater input into the ocean.

Close collaboration is expected with other glaciologists and oceanographers within the project cluster, e.g., to obtain data for calibration and validation, to distribute runoff estimates used as a boundary condition for other models, and to ensure consistency with ice sheet model-based mass change estimates.

#### To apply successfully, you will:
- have a PhD in a field of Earth science with proven, strong mathematical/physical background, or a PhD in physics/mathematics/informatics with previous experience in an Earth science;
- have experience in glaciology and/or oceanography;
- have a publication record in peer-reviewed, international journals;
- have demonstrated skills in scientific programming;
- be fluent in English (equivalent to CEFR level C1).

#### It will be advantageous if you can demonstrate:
- working experience in a supercomputing environment;
- working experience with Python;
- proficiency in German.

Questions regarding the positon should be addressed to Ben Marzeion (_ben.marzeion [at] uni-bremen.de_).

The University of Bremen is an equal opportunity employer and aims particularly at increasing the share of female faculty members in research and teaching. Thus, qualified women are especially encouraged to apply. International applications and those from candidates with a migration background are explicitly appreciated. Candidates with disabilities will be given preference in case of equal qualifications.
