**The 2019 OGGM workshop will take place from June 17th to 21st in Grenoble,
France.**

### What is it ?

The OGGM workshop is an annual, informal meeting for developers, users, and future users
of the [OGGM](http://docs.oggm.org) model. Like last year, this 4th edition
is open to any interested scientist (within the limits of our capacities!).

### Save the date

**Monday 17th to Wednesday 19th June 2019 for the workshop, and Thursday 20th to 
Friday 21st June 2019 for the trainings and coding sessions (optional)**. If you are coming 
from far away, you might plan one day before and/or after the workshop for travel.

### Location

At [Hôtel les Mésanges](http://www.hotel-les-mesanges.com/),
in the vicinity of Grenoble for the workshop. The facilities include full board
hotel rooms, seminar rooms, and a great view on the Vercors mountains.

At [IGE lab](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/), in the Saint-Martin d'Hères campus close 
to Grenoble for the trainings. The facilities include only the seminar rooms.

### Agenda

The the first part of the workshop (17-19th of June) has two main objectives:

1. **State of OGGM** : the first sessions will be spent with presentations from the
participants about recent developments and results.

2. **Future developments and visions for OGGM** : the rest of the sessions
will be dedicated to general discussions and brainstorming about the future and 
goals of the OGGM project.

This workshop will be followed by two days of training and coding session 
in smaller groups at the IGE in Grenoble:

- **Beginner tutorials**: these sessions are for current and future OGGM users to
  get to know the model internals, and learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
- **Code sprints**: we will address specific coding challenges
  together, in the form of a [programming sprint](https://oggm.org/2018/10/16/hack-day/).
- **Q&A**: we will leave time open to discuss actual problems in the model itself,
  and try to develop strategies to solve them.

This second part is targetting current and future model *users*, or 
maybe just people interested in the model internals. 
It will be rather technical and could be skipped if you do not plan to
use the model yourself.

### Who can participate ?

Anyone interested in the model, or in glaciological modeling
in general! In particular, we would like to encourage potential users and
developers to join us to get to know each other and to gather first-hand
information about the model internals, as well as PhD students and young scientists.
Note that in case of high interest we might have to limit the number of participants.

### Workshop fee

**For the workshop part**, the hotel accomodation (night & breakfeast)
is €90 in a single room and €56 in a twin room. The prices are per night per person.
The conference fees are €240 covering all other organization costs
(including all meals).

**For the training part** there are no fees, but attendants should take 
care of their own accomodation and meals.

### Registration

If you wish to participate to the workshop or if you have questions regarding
the organization please send us an e-mail at _info [at] oggm.org_
