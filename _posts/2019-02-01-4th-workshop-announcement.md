**The 2019 OGGM workshop will take place from June 17th to 19th in Grenoble,
France.**

### What is it ?

The OGGM workshop is an annual, informal meeting for developers, users, and future users
of the [OGGM](http://docs.oggm.org) model. For this fourth edition, as for the third edition, we
open the event to any interested scientist (within the limits of our capacities!).

### Save the date

Monday midday 17 to Wednesday 19 June 2019. If you are coming from far away, you might
plan one day before and/or after the workshop for travel.

### Location

At [Hôtel les Mésanges](http://www.hotel-les-mesanges.com/),
in the vicinity of Grenoble. The facilities include full board
hotel rooms, seminar rooms, and a great view on the Vercors mountains.

### Agenda

This workshop has three main objectives:

1. **State of OGG*** : the first day will be spent with presentations from the
participants about recent developments and results.

2. **Future developments and visions for OGGM** : the second day will be dedicated
to general discussions and brainstorming about the future and 
goals of the OGGM project.

3. **Tutorial**: the third day is for current and future OGGM users to
get to know the model internals, and learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
This day will be rather technical and might be skipped if you do not plan to
use the model yourself.

### Who can participate ?

Anyone interested in the model, or in glaciological modeling
in general! In particular, we would like to encourage potential users and
developers to join us to get to know each other and to gather first-hand
information about the model internals. Note that in case of high interest
we might have to limit the number of participants.

### Workshop fee

The hotel reservation & breakfeast is €90.1 for a single room in a single room and
€55.6 per night per person in a twin room. There will probably be no conference
fees, other organization costs (including all meals) will be covered by OGGM e.V.
