**The 2018 OGGM workshop will take place from May 23rd to 25th in Innsbruck,
Austria.**

### What is it?

The OGGM workshop is an annual, informal meeting for developers, users, and future users
of the [OGGM](http://oggm.readthedocs.io) model. For this third edition, we
decided to open the event to any interested scientist (within the limits of our capacities!).

### Save the date

Wednesday 23 to Friday 25 May 2018. If you are coming from far away, you might
plan one day before and/or after the workshop for travel.

### Location

At [Bildungsinstitut Grillhof](https://www.tirol.gv.at/bildung/bildungsinstitut-grillhof/),
in the close vicinity of Innsbruck. The facilities include full board
hotel rooms, seminar rooms, and a great view on the Inn valley.

### Agenda

This workshop has three main objectives:

1. **State of OGGM**: the first day will be spent with presentations from the
participants about recent developments and results.

2. **Future developments and visions for OGGM**: the second day will be dedicated
to general discussions and brainstorming about the future and
goals of the OGGM project.

3. **Tutorial**: the third day is for current and future OGGM users to
get to know the model internals, and learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
This day will be rather technical and might be skipped if you do not plan to
use the model yourself.

### Who can participate?

Anyone interested in the model, or in glaciological modeling
in general! In particular, we would like to encourage potential users and
developers to join us to get to know each other and to gather first-hand
information about the model internals. Note that in case of high interest
we might have to limit the number of participants.

### Workshop fee

In addition to the hotel reservation (€79 per night per person in a double room
including all meals, €89 for a single room), there will be a small conference
fee to cover the other organization costs (exact amount to be announced, but
probably no more than €100 per person).

### Registration

If you wish to participate to the workshop or if you have questions regarding
the organization please send us an e-mail at _info [at] oggm.org_
**before January 12th, 2018**.
