### What is it?

The workshop continues the tradition of bringing together the global glacier-modelling community — developers and users alike — to share advances, exchange ideas, and foster collaboration. It follows the successful [workshop in Oslo in 2025](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/projects/glacmass/news/clobal-glacier-modeling-workshop.html) and builds on the [series of workshops organised by the OGGM consortium](https://oggm.org/search/#workshop) since 2016.

 **We welcome anyone interested in large-scale glacier evolution modelling and related challenges** (e.g. observational datasets at large scales). “Large-scale” here refers to the ability to simulate or monitor at least one entire [RGI region](https://www.glims.org/rgi_user_guide/02_regions_definition.html).

This edition is special in two ways:

- It marks the **10th anniversary** of [the first OGGM workshop in Obergurgl](https://oggm.org/2016/02/11/1st-oggm-worshop-summary/). A small celebration will definitely be in order!
- We will host a **dedicated GlacierMIP4 session**, focusing on the next phase of the [Glacier Model Intercomparison Project](https://climate-cryosphere.org/working-groups/glaciermip/). Participants in GlacierMIP4 are especially encouraged to attend (remote participation will be offered for this session).

### Topics

- Modelling of glaciers at regional to global scales
- Glacier change projections and associated impacts (hydrology, hazards, sea-level rise), as well as paleo-simulations and glacier reconstructions
- Sensitivity of large-scale glacier evolution models to climate forcing, input datasets, and model parameterisation choices
- Advances in modelling climatic mass balance, frontal ablation, and ice dynamics in large-scale frameworks, including process-based and machine-learning approaches
- Calibration and validation of glacier evolution models
- Data assimilation, ice-thickness inversion, and integration of heterogeneous observational datasets
- Development and use of large-scale datasets relevant for global glacier modelling

---

### Agenda

The agenda will be developed in the lead-up to the workshop. We aim to maintain a flexible schedule that adapts to participants’ needs, interests, and suggestions. Typically, sessions will include oral and poster presentations, group discussions, hands-on activities, and open brainstorming.

---

### Venue

The workshop will take place at the [University Centre Obergurgl](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/uz-obergurgl/) from Monday 24 August to Friday 28 August 2026.

Obergurgl can be reached by taking a train to **Ötztal Bahnhof** on the Innsbruck–Zürich line, followed by a bus to the village of **Obergurgl**. Nearby transport hubs include **Innsbruck** (closest), **Munich**, and **Zurich**.

### Costs

The costs below are indicative and will be finalised when registration opens. Participants can expect a conference fee for meeting facilities and coffee breaks, plus accommodation costs: about €100 per person per night in shared rooms or €140 for single rooms, including breakfast and dinner.
