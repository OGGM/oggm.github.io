In this day of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, I report about our recent OGGM workshop.
It was our fourth meeting altogether, but also the
[first one to be hosted outside than the two institutions of origin, i.e. Bremen University and Innsbruck University](/2019/02/01/2019-02-01-4th-workshop-announcement.md/).
The Workshop indeed took place in Grenoble, France, and was jointly organised with the Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/).

We had 18 participants, 7 of which without previous OGGM experience who came
to learn about the model. The workshop was a real success in many aspects,
one of them being the [great location](http://www.hotel-les-mesanges.com/)
behind St-Martin d'Hères hills!

We had a Workshop in two stages ([program](/img/blog/4th_workshop/4th_OGGM_workshop_program.pdf)).
The first three days at Hôtel Mésanges were dedicated to talk and discussion sessions:

1. **Introduction/state-of-art of OGGM and its future**: the first day was spent with 6 presentations
from the participants about a general overview of OGGM and what will be its future. We had the pleasure
to listen to Fabien Gillet-Chaulet talking about the Elmer/Ice model
(dedicated for ice sheet modeling) from the Glaciology
Laboratory of Grenoble. In addition, it was great to know more about OGGM on the cloud and OGGM-edu,
the dedicated education branch of OGGM, and how promising these two aspects are!

2. **Recent results and developments with OGGM**: the second day was spent with 10 presentations divided
in 3 thematic blocks: glaciers in the past, glacier surface mass balance and
glacier ice thickness. We end up the day in the hotel garden area with specific topic discussions
which have been very interactive using just a whiteboard! The goal was to find easy way of implement
the dynamical evolution of calving, how to initialize the model in the past and which baseline climate
OGGM uses for calibration.

3. **Open discussions and open thematics**: The last day at the hotel was spent with 2 presentations on rock glaciers
and global future projections of glacier evolution, following by lot of discussions. The discussions were about
data limitation, uncertainties and project communication.

The last two days took place at the Glaciology Laboratory in Grenoble. Those days were dedicated for
the beginners to learn how to perform simulations with the model (beginner tutorials) as well as doing
simulation directly on the cloud. For more experienced users, a new graphic tutorial was developed to learn
about new graphic tools. Finally, quite lot of time was free for everybody to do their own work: it could
have been learn more about the model, improving the model documentation or participating to the code development.

We are very glad that many could come to this workshop and I am looking
forward to the next one in 2019!
