In this first autumn days in the Northern Hemisphere, we report about our recent OGGM workshop. 
It was our fifth meeting altogether, but more importantly the first one since 2 years because of the
COVID-19 pandemic and it was a real face-to-face workshop [2021-04-13-5th-workshop-new-date-again.md](/2021/04/13/2021-04-13-5th-workshop-new-date-again.md).
You can easily imagine how pleasant and constructive it was to meet again in the same location during one week !
Real discussions, exchanges and drinks altogether are so essentiel for our works.

The Workshop took place in Neuharlingersiel, Germany, and was jointly organised
by the Institut des GÃ©osciences de l'Environnement [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/), the university
of Bremen [https://www.geographie.uni-bremen.de/en/climate-geography](https://www.geographie.uni-bremen.de/en/climate-geography)
and the university of Innsbruck [https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/index.html.en](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/index.html.en).
We had 26 participants, around 10 of which without previous OGGM experience who came
to learn about the model. The group includes more and more different institutes every year (8 different research
institute this year) and a good balance between female and male (14-12). The workshop was probably the most sucessfull, partly due to 
the in-person meeting but also due to the intense, deep discussion and brainstorming we had, and with no doubt
thanks to the boat excursion on [North sea](https://www.neuharlingersiel.de/) and the pub quizz
with a remarkable friendly ambiance !

We had a Workshop with different 3 different activities: typical sessions of oral presentation, 
hands-on tutorials and group discussions and braimstorming ([program](/img/blog/5th_workshop/5th_OGGM_workshop_program_2021.pdf)).
There were 5 sessions with oral presentations that cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction and general overview of OGGM**: after a short introduction from the organizers and a first
meet together since a long time, an amazing overview of what is OGGM, a little bit of OGGM history and
importantly the philosophy and goal of the modelling framework was one by Fabien Maussion. In addition, we
started discussion about building together the future of OGGM and what recommandations and ideas we can provide
to the glacier community.

2. **Glacier hydrology**: two presentations were dedicated to this this emerging topic, and this subject was
present in our minds I guess during all the week thanks to its very promising scientific and societal interests,
as well as the recent model developments to improve the "glacier catchment hydrology".

3. **Glaciological data, model calibration, validation and comparison**: this thematic block led by Michael Zemp
was really impressive especially because the recent availability of global coverage of mass-balance observations
from satellite and the great project to combine satellite (global coverage) and in-situ observations(fine 
temporal resolution). This session had 5 presentations covering also the comparison with other models and the
different parametrizations in OGGM.

4. **Recent developments**: this session that includes 5 presentations showed how alive is the community and
how lot of different approaches tend to be included in the OGGM framework. It highlights the easiness to include
new formulation of processes. Those developments concern among others marine-terminating glaciers, debris-covered glaciers,
ice thickness inversion and surface mass-balance formulation.

5. **Glacier evolution, past and future**: the last session dedicated to the use of OGGM for past and future
glacier evolution includes 5 presentations, coming from the past to the future and from regional to global
application and also presented new way to think about the future of glacier by looking at the targets in 
a future point of time, either in term of global/regional warming, either in term of greenhouse gas emissions.

The hands-on tutorials were dedicated to beginner and more advanced tutorials, the presentation, discussion
and tutorials about[OGGM-edu](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/) and its amazing applications. We had 3 long times
for discussion on:

1. uncertainties into glacier modelling in general and OGGM specifficaly (based mainly on
GlacierMIP2 results published in 2020, Marzeion et al.) as how to best use the in-situ and satellite data for
calibration and validation.

2. hydrological applications and challenges, in particular the spatial scale of glacier and hydrological models
and their imbrication, the differences in precipitation in the two communities of modelling and how
to include the future disappearance of glaciers into the hydrological framework modelling.

3. the future of OGGM, the ideas and applications that can be done and the development that are necessary. We also
discussed about how the OGGM community works and what should be improved !

We are very glad that many could come to this workshop and we are looking forward to the next one in 2022!

The full output from this workshop will take the form of a collaborative "white paper" (if you are interested in
participating, just provide your comments and updates
[here](https://github.com/nchampollion/OGGM-future/blob/main/main.md)) and probably some new
[OGGM Enhancement Proposals](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/oeps.html).
