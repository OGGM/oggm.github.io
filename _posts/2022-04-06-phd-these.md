The doctoral school "Science de la Terre, de l'Environnement et des Planètes" ([STEP](https://edstep.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/francais/)) of [Grenoble Alpes university](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), France, invites applications for the following PhD position, starting October 1st, 2022, for the duration of 3 years. The PhD will take place at the "Institut des Géosciences de l'Environnement" ([IGE](https://www.ige-grenoble.fr/)), a research laboratory of around 300 persons studying the components of the Earth system and their interactions (cryosphere, hydrosphere, ocean, atmosphere).

The successful candidate will work on assessing the uncertainties of
global glacier modeling. The candidate will use the [Open Global Glacier Model](http://oggm.org), a state-of-the art, open-source, 
flexible large-scale glacier modelling framework written in Python. OGGM is used by 
several research groups worldwide to compute large scale past and future glacier 
changes as well as associated impacts.

We seek to evaluate the uncertainties of future projections of global glacier evolution with OGGM model by:
- quantifying the uncertainties at each time step of the model worflow (parameter sensitivity analysis, various input datasets)
- quantifying the global uncertainty of the model
- performing statistic emulation of the model

Close collaboration is expected with the active community of OGGM users, and with the 
main groups currently working and developing the OGGM model at the University of Innsbruck, the University of Bremen and the University of Grenoble.
Bringing innovative ideas to the OGGM project and its ecosystem is warmly welcome.

To apply successfully, the student candidate needs to have a master degree in a field of Earth, physics, mathematics or computational sciences.
It will be advantageous if the candidate can demonstrate:
- experience in the field of glaciology and climate
- knowledges and skills in python language and finite element modeling
- proficiency in scientific English, and basics in French

In the spirit of equality and inclusion, all qualified applicants are encouraged to apply.

**Please submit your application including a letter of motivation and a CV (with ranking and/or rating)
until end of April 2022 to [Nicolas Champollion](mailto:nicolas.champollion@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) and [Gael Durand](mailto:gael.durand@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).
