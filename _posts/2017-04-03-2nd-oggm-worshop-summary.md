**The second OGGM workshop was hold from 30.03.2017 to 02.04.2017 in
Spiekeroog, northern Germany**. We had 12 participants (2 more than last year!)
and a very important guest: Hugues Goosse (UCL in Belgium), who is going to
use OGGM for paleo-climate studies.

Like last year the workshop was a real success, and the wonderful location and
nice weather surely had a role to play, too. The program was quite full, with
several status reports about the latest developments (calving, divides,
bed shapes...) and discussions about future plans.
