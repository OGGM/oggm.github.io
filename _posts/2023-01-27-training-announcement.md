In March 10-16, 2023, we will offer the **Glacier modelling: Practical
applications with the Open Global Glacier Model** training at LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan, in
collaboration with the Himalayan University Consortium. This event is open to Pakistan
based applicants and is free of charge! The workshop has a specific focus on the region
and has a larger training component than the annual OGGM workshops. More information about
the training and how to apply can be found in the following
[flyer](https://huc-hkh.org//storage/files/15/4562g_20230117_EP_HUCTrainingGlacierMonitoring_6_Final.pdf).

Especially to those of you that are now a little disappointed to not be eligible
for this training, we will soon announce the next annual OGGM workshop! The workshop will
take place at the end of summer in Edinburgh, Scotland, and will be announced via the
usual channels (cryolist, OGGM slack and off course here in the news section).
