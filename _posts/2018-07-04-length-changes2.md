A couple of months ago Fabien Maussion wrote about [glacier length changes
under a random climate](https://oggm.org/2017/10/23/length-changes).
He showed an experiment where the model was run with a random climate around
year t$$^{*}$$.

t$$^{*}$$ is obtained through mass-balance calibration within the model and
represents an glacier equilibrium state.
A random climate withing OGGM is generated by randomly choosing the yearly
meteorological model input from from a 31-year period centered around a given
year (t$^{*}$ in this case).
With this method it is possible, but very unlikely, that one specific year
(e.g. t$$^{*}$$)  is used by the model in several consecutive years.

Fabien's experiment showed for [Hintereisferner](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/research/ice-and-climate/projects/opal)
that with such a random climate sequence absolute length changes of the order
of kilometers are possible.


## Length changes under a current random climate

In this follow up we will run similar random climate scenarios, but instead of
centering the climate period around year t$$^{*}$$, we now center the period
around the year 1995. Thus the random mass balance model will choose years from
the climate period 1980-2010.
We run the model for 5 different random sequences:

For the first 50-60 years all 5 runs follow a very similar retreating track[^1].
After this strong retreat the scenarios start to deviate and, comparable to the
last experiment, individual runs show absolute length changes of the order of
kilometers.


We now repeat this experiment for other Alpine glaciers and use the same 5
climate sequences:

All glaciers show a initial retreat within the first 50 years, but with
different magnitudes: Aletschgletscher, the largest glacier within the Alps,
also shows the largest initial retreat.
On the other hand the initial retreat of Tschiervagletscher,
a glacier with less than 10% of Aletschgletscher's size,
is also one order of magnitude smaller.

After the initial retreat the glaciers respond in different ways to the random
climate: Aletschgletscher and also Tschiervagletscher show absolute length
changes which are comparable to the previous shown Hintereisferner.
But Pasterze (and also less pronounced Gepatschferner) show less
variability within the individual runs. And also the spread between the
different runs is smaller compared to the other glaciers.


## Preliminary conclusion

5 random sequences are not statistically valuable by any means.
And nor are the 30 runs shown below.
But the experiment still shows some interesting results:

None of the random scenarios was able to reproduce a glacier extend which is
comparable to the model initialisation[^2] within the 400 year simulation.
This is especially true for larger glaciers.

All glaciers react differently. This might sound like a trivial remark, but
it makes research in this field interesting and challenging. And it shows
the advantage of treating glaciers as individual entities within a model, even
on global and millennial scales.
