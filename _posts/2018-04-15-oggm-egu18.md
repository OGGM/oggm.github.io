There were a lot more contibutions from the OGGM team at this EGU Assembly. A total of 5 researchers presented the moldel and/or their research using OGGM accross different sessions. See abstracts: [EGU2018-1649](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-1649.pdf), [EGU2018-13714](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-13714.pdf), [EGU2018-3039](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-3039.pdf), [EGU2018-4615](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-4615.pdf), [EGU2018-3983](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-3983.pdf), .

According to the questions and the feedbacks from the audience the talk and posters were a success! We are excited that the team gets larger every year and had more representation at EGU than previous assamblies. We even got the attention of the EGU cartoonists who draw one of the [#CartoonAbstracts](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CartoonAbstracts?src=hash) for us:
