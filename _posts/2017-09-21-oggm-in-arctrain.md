Two PhD students (Anouk and Beatriz) currently working with OGGM, joined the The In­ter­na­tio­nal Re­se­arch Trai­ning Group [ArcTrain](https://www.marum.de/Ausbildung-Karriere/ArcTrain.html): "Processes and impacts of climate change in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Canadian Arctic". 
The program aims to edu­ca­te PhD stu­dents in an in­ter­di­sci­pli­na­ry en­vi­ron­ment, combining the strength in ma­ri­ne geo­sci­en­ces and en­vi­ron­men­tal phy­sics in Bre­men with com­ple­men­ta­ry skills and ex­per­ti­se in sea-ice and ice-sheet/glacier mo­de­ling in a con­sor­ti­um of eight Ca­na­di­an part­ner uni­ver­si­ties. 

The research conducted with the model was presented during Arc­Train An­nu­al Mee­ting (18th to 20th of Sep­tem­ber 2017) via talks and poster presentations from both students. See the [Program](https://www.marum.de/Binaries/Binary4846/ArcTrain-IV-Annual-Meeting-Program-FINAL.pdf) for more information.
