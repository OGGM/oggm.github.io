Earlier this year, we organized a [training on glacier modelling](https://oggm.org/2023/01/27/training-announcement) in collaboration with 
the [Himalayan University Consortium (HUC)](https://www.huc-hkh.org) and the [Centre for Water Informatics & Technology](https://wit.lums.edu.pk/) 
at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk), Lahore, Pakistan.

Here are some video impressions from the workshop, created by our colleagues at LUMS. Enjoy!
