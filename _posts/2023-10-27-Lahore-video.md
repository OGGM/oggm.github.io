Earlier this year we organized the Glacier modelling: Practical applications with the Open Global Glacier Model 
[training](https://oggm.org/2023/01/27/training-announcement/) in collaboration with the Himalayan University 
Consortium at LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan. Here we would like to share the youtube video, created by our 
colleagues at the Centre for Water Informatics & Technology LUMS, that gives a nice impression of the training week.
