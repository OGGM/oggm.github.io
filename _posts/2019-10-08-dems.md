The main reason for this short blog post is to document how and why we split
some digital elevation models (DEMs) into multiple smaller pieces.
But let us start with a small introduction to *the DEM problem*:

For each glacier we want to simulate in the OGGM framework we need two
topographical items: The outlines of the glacier and the underlying
topography. The first we get from the
[Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/RGI/) (RGI), a global
inventory of individual glacier shapefiles. For the latter we need a suitable
DEM and this is where things get more complicated.
OGGM of course allows the user to provide a specific
(e.g. publicly not available) DEM. A tutorial about this can be found
[here](http://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/oggm_tuto.html).
But in general the OGGM workflow is such that the user does not have to choose
a DEM her/himself. By default OGGM chooses between several freely available
DEM sources depending on the region of the glacier.

### DEM requirements

For a DEM to be **automatically** usable within the OGGM workflow it needs to
fulfill some criteria: First and foremost the DEM must be freely available, at
least for scientific purpose.  
Next important point is the quality of the DEM.
Data gaps are always a problem and this is especially true for steep
mountainous terrain, which is unfortunately where most glaciers are located. Worse than data
gaps (which can be identified and interpolated if small)
are wrong values within the DEM. Wrong values are often hard to detect and
such a DEM should therefor be avoided in an automatic process.  
Another criteria
is the resolution of the DEM. For OGGM it should be high enough to represent
all important features of a small mountain glacier. But it should not be so
high that the additional resolution causes performance issues on global scale
runs due to intensified file handling. Our rule of thumb choice would be a
resolution between 50 and 150m.  
Last point but rather important when analysing the current state of glaciers is
the date when the DEM was acquired. The RGI outlines are a snapshot of the
glaciers state at a certain time. Most outlines in the current version RGIv6
are from around 2003. But this is not consistent through the inventory and is
likely to change with future RGI versions. The DEM date and the RGI date should
be as close as possible.

A list of the different DEMs which are currently available within OGGM, their
problems, and our standard choices can be found
[here](https://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dems.html).


### Data sources and acknowledgments

If possible OGGM will download the DEM directly from the
original data provider. In some cases we decided to mirror the DEM on our own
data server and let OGGM get it from there. This might be necessary if there is
no usable API or the network performance of the original source is extremely
poor.

**Every OGGM user is responsible to thoroughly attribute and acknowledge the
original data provider if required by their license terms.**
In order to support this,
OGGM provides a text file called `dem_source.txt` in every
[GlacierDirectory](https://oggm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#glacier-directories)
which contains the requested acknowledgments and citations of the DEM used for
this individual glacier. But we recommend to always double check the license
terms with the original data source.


### Downloading the DEMs

OGGM stores all automatically downloaded files
(DEMs, outlines, climate data, ...) in a local cache directory.
This directory will be checked before any download to avoid downloading the
same file twice.

To additionally minimize network usage and file handling OGGM only downloads
necessary DEM tiles and not the whole DEM.
This is possible for most but not all DEMs:  
[ArcticDEM](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/) and
[REMA](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/)
(both provided by the
[Polar Geospatial Center (PGC)](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/))
are only available as single GeoTiff files (at 100m resolution)
and cover the whole Arctic or Antarctic respectively.
For a regional run with one of these DEMs the single GeoTiff would only have to
be downloaded once. But it would be necessary to read the large file and
extract the actual glacier area for every glacier within that run.  
To avoid this costly file I/O we decided to cut the original 100m REMA and
ArcticDEM into multiple DEM tiles and provide these to OGGM from our own data
server. Both DEMs were cut in the pattern of the respective *Tile Index*
which are provided by the PGC for the higher resolution versions of the two
DEMs.

To enable others to reproduce this task we here document the few necessary
Python commands as an example for REMA:
```python
import geopandas as gpd
from subprocess import Popen
import os
from oggm import utils

# read the full REMA GeoTiff
dem_full = 'REMA_100m_dem.tif'

# read the REMA Tile Index
gdf = gpd.read_file('REMA_Tile_Index_Rel1.1.shp')

for i in range(len(gdf)):
    # separate one tile from the tile index
    tile = gdf.iloc[[i]]

    # create one directory for every tile
    name = '{}_100m_v1.1'.format(tile.iloc[0].tile)
    out_dir = os.path.join('REMA_100m_v1.1', name)
    utils.mkdir(out_dir, reset=True)

    # make and write one shapefile for every tile, necessary for gdalwarp  
    index_dir = os.path.join(out_dir, 'index')
    shp_file = os.path.join(index_dir, name + '_index.shp')
    utils.mkdir(index_dir)
    tile.to_file(shp_file)

    # name of the GeoTiff tile  
    dem_tile = os.path.join(out_dir, name + '_reg_dem.tif')

    # Use gdalwarp -cutline as shell command to cut one tile at a time
    command = 'gdalwarp -cutline {} -crop_to_cutline -of GTiff {} {}'.format(shp_file, dem_full, dem_tile)
    p = Popen(command, shell=True)
    p.wait()
```

For the Alaska DEM we did the same, except that we had to create the
tile file ourselves. [Here](https://gist.github.com/fmaussion/c817026404a9b1ecbec94249deeabba9)
is the code that we used, and the tile shapefile is available in the
oggm-sample-data repository.
