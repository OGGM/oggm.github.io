I'm happy to announce that a project related to [OGGM Edu](https://edu.oggm.org)
has been funded by the University of Innsbruck!

The project is named *"Glacier Modelling on the Cloud: Research and Education
in a Web Browser"* (short: **GlacioCloud**). You can download the proposal
[here](/img/blog/glaciocloud/GlacioCloud_Proposal_Final.pdf).

It will be a cooperation between the [ACINN](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/), the
[Digital Science Center](https://www.uibk.ac.at/disc/index.html.en), the
[Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](http://dps.uibk.ac.at/~tf/) of the
University of Innsbruck, and members of the [Pangeo Project](http://pangeo.io/).
It will run for one year (starting 01.05.2019) and
is financed by the [Förderkreis 1669 – Wissenschafft Gesellschaft](https://www.uibk.ac.at/foerderkreis1669)
(20k€).

Thanks to all people involved! Now, to the most important part:

## Job openings

We are seeking to hire up to three master students at 8 hours per week for a
duration of 6 months, renewable for another 6 months depending on performance.
The net salary for 8 hrs/week is about 400€ per month.
We are looking for students with a strong interest in
programming, computer sciences and glaciology.

These openings are only available to **master level students _at the
University of Innsbruck_**. Other candidates will *not* be considered.

Each student will work on one of the following tasks:

### Task 1: educational notebooks

In this task, you will improve and extend the existing set of
[educational notebooks](http://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/index.html#interactive-notebooks)
about glaciers. You will design modelling experiments and write notebooks
to convey the experiments' results.

**Tools**: [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/),
[OGGM](https://oggm.org/)

**Your profile**: creative, curious, interested in writing teaching material,
with good programming and English skills and a strong interest in glaciology.

### Task 2: interactive web applications

In this task, your will develop web applications to be hosted
on the OGGM-Edu platform. An example of such an application can be found
[here](https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/bokeh/app). Interactivity is possible
thanks to a server in the background,
which runs [python code](https://github.com/OGGM/bokeh-apps).
You will build similar applications using the OGGM model and the tools below.

**Tools**: [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org) and [PyViz](http://pyviz.org/)
(alternatively, [Plotly](https://plot.ly) and [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)).

**Your profile**: creative, interested in interactive visualization programming,
independent learner, problem solver, strong interest in
programming and in glaciology.

### Task 3: cloud deployment

In this task, your will be responsible for setting up and maintaining a
deployment of the OGGM model on a cloud infrastructure. Examples of
similar deployments can be found on the [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/deployments.html)
website. The goal is to provide a Jupyterlab interface to authenticated users,
with the OGGM model installed and runnable in a scalable environment.  

**Tools**: [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) (or similar),
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io).

**Your profile**: proficient with linux, interested in IT administration with
a focus on cloud deployment, independent learner, problem solver,
ideally with a background in computer sciences.

**For this task, it is recommended/possible to have a shorter contract with
more hours per week. We provide more technical details
[here](https://hackmd.io/s/BkpfZAHc4).**

Please contact [Thomas Fahringer](http://dps.uibk.ac.at/~tf/) or
[myself](http://fabienmaussion.info) if you have any questions!

## How to apply?

First, read the proposal carefully and explore the websites of OGGM and
OGGM-Edu as well as the tools listed above. To apply, send
[me](http://fabienmaussion.info) an email with:
- a short CV (including list of project relevant lectures taken and grades, and
  work experience)
- letter of motivation (max one A4 page) with a short statement about which
  task(s) you would like to work on, and why

All applications sent until **Friday 26th of April** will be considered. Later
applications might be considered until the positions are filled. Note that if
you expect to graduate within the next 6 months there is no need to apply, we
are looking for students able to work for at least 6 months.

We are looking forward to welcome you in the OGGM team!
