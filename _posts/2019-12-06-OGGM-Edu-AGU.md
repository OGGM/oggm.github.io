Last summer, our colleague and collaborator [Lizz Ultee](https://ehultee.github.io/)
conducted a [weeklong workshop on Glaciology and Glacial Water Resources](https://www.clubesdecienciaperu.org/cdc024) at
the [Clubes de Ciencia Perú 2019](https://www.clubesdecienciaperu.org/).

Parts of her materials were provided by [OGGM-Edu](http://edu.oggm.org) and then
translated and extended by her for the specific learning outcomes of the workshop.
You can find her notebooks (in Spanish)
[on github](https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia).

We are thrilled to see our platform used in this way, as this is exactly the
kind of applications we hoped our platform would facilitate.

In addition to the notebooks templates, we also provided a dedicated
[Jupyter Hub](https://docs.oggm.org/en/latest/cloud.html) with which the students
could run their notebooks online, in a controlled environment.

    cells of executable Python code. Activities for students appear in bold. Tabs (near the top) separate active notebooks. Additional files, such as
    the raw Python code for commonly used functions (CdeC.py), appear in the left sidebar file directory. (Screenshot: L. Ultee)</i></figcaption>
