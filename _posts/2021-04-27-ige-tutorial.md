In the context of Fabien's visit to the IGE in Grenoble, we will organize an afternoon tutorial for all lab members interested in OGGM.

#### When?

Tuesday May 18th!
- 15H - 15H45: general presentation and discussion
- 16H - 18H: online tutorials

#### Where?

Via zoom, unfortunately. The room link will be shared internally: contact us if you didn't receive it!

#### Who?

Anybody from IGE interested in OGGM and glacier modelling in general! The first part (presentation) will be 
very general and tailored for a general audience of glaciologists and glacier modellers. The second 
part (tutorials) is for the curious and interested alike, who would like to see how OGGM is built and
run it themselves "on the cloud".

#### What will we do?

**Part I (15H00-15H45)**: presentation of the OGGM project.
- Objectives of OGGM
- OGGM as a "modelling framework"
- What OGGM does *not* intend to be
- Current developments and future plans
- Open discussion

**Part II (16H-18H)**: online tutorials.
- [Getting started](https://oggm.org/tutorials/notebooks/getting_started.html): building blocks of OGGM, fundamentals
- [Hydrological applications]() (in construction): a fun application of OGGM
- Based on interest / demand: projections with OGGM, mass-balance, ice-thickness inversion, etc...


#### Do I need to prepare anything?

No! The tutorials will run online on [OGGM-Hub](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/hub.html). Some experience with 
Python and Jupyter Notebooks is useful, but not mandatory.
