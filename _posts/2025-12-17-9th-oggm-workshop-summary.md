Here comes a short summary of the 9<sup>th</sup> OGGM workshop, which was hosted by the Water and Climate Department of the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Belgium](https://www.vub.be/en). Our summary is a few months delayed and even comes after the announcement of the [next workshop](https://oggm.org/2025/12/08/10th-workshop-announcement/); but better late than never ;-)

This year’s workshop was shorter, more OGGM-focused, and, unlike previous years, did not include any hands-on or beginner sessions. Apart from the usual OGGM crew, we also had participants from our sister models, e.g. people working with IGM, ODINN, GloGEM or the massbalance-machine.

The programme included individual presentations on “large-scale OGGM applications and other related global glacier models” as well as on “OGGM-related processes”, with plenty of time reserved for open discussions of the presented topics.

We also had dedicated group discussions on “OGGM central activities” to provide updates on the status of OGGM and its governance, as well as on “Glacier-related hydrology”, “Machine learning for glacier modelling”, and “Future OGGM plans”. In addition, we discussed potential OGGM contributions to GlacierMIP4 and had time for specific additional topics in small groups.

On the first evening, the locals organised a short sightseeing tour of Brussels, which concluded in a cosy brasserie with plenty of food and drinks.
