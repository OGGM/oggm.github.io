<h3>OGGM Open Calls</h3>

<p>There are two types of open meetings we have regularly have on-line within the OGGM community. 
We hold check-in meetings every second Wednesday. These meetings are held on Slack 
(<a href="mailto:info@oggm.org">reach out</a> if you want
to join in). The check-in meetings are a good place to keep up to date of what’s happening, ask 
questions and discuss work in progress. In addition on the other Wednesdays we have started the 
OGGM “Science Café”. The science café is a meeting were we can have a discussion on a specific topic 
(e.g. discuss an article) or have a (invited) presentation on a topic that is relevant to the community. 
Both these meetings are open to anyone!</p>

<p>Currently the meetings are at 16:00 CET/CEST, but we can change this to accommodate for
other time zones. A google calendar has been setup with these regular times
(<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=34b998vus0mcp3k766dl7vulm0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon">GCAL</a> / <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/34b998vus0mcp3k766dl7vulm0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">ICAL</a>).
The OGGM “Science Cafés” only take place when there is content, so suggestions are very much welcome. 
If the status remains “Open Time Slot”, the meeting is not happening on that specific date. For more info about 
the content of a specific science cafe, click on the meeting in the calendar bellow:</p>
