## About

**OGGM is an open source model for glacier dynamics**

Extending [Marzeion et al., (2012)](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/1295/2012/tc-6-1295-2012.html),
the model accounts for glacier geometry (including contributory branches) and
includes an explicit ice dynamics module. It can simulate past and
future mass-balance, volume and geometry of (almost) any glacier in the world
in a fully automated workflow. We rely exclusively on publicly available data for
calibration and validation.

Please [get in touch](#get-involved) with us if you are interested in using
the model or if you'd like to contribute to the project!

## Mission

<p>
<center>
<i>
"Develop a <strong>global</strong> scale, <strong>modular</strong>, and
<strong>open source</strong> numerical model framework for <strong>consistently</strong>
simulating past and future global scale glacier change"
</i>
</center>
</p>

*Global* not only in the sense of leading to meaningful results for all
 glaciers combined, but also for any small ensemble of glaciers, e.g. at the
 headwater catchment scale. *Modular* to allow different approaches to the
 representation of ice flow and surface mass balance to be combined and
 compared against each other. *Open source* so that the code can be
 read and used by anyone and so that new modules can be added and discussed by
 the community, following the principles of transparency and open governance.
 *Consistent* in order to provide well-defined uncertainty measures at all
 realizable scales.

## Motivation

Our project is motivated by the far reaching goal of contributing
(and helping others to contribute) to answers of some of the
“big questions” in Earth Sciences:
- How much ice is stored on the glaciers on Earth?
- How much ice was present on Earth at the beginning of the 20th century, and how much ice will be lost by the end of the 21st?
- What are the uncertainties associated with these numbers, and where do they originate?
- How much model complexity is just right?
- ...

We envision the model as a seed that has high potential to grow into a
self-sustained, community-driven global scale model for glaciers. It will enable
regional and global studies of glacier-climate interactions
without the need for a self-developed tool, and open new possibilities to run
model or parameterization intercomparisons in a controlled environment.
