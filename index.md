## About

**OGGM is an open source modelling framework for glaciers**

The model can simulate past and future mass-balance, volume and geometry of (almost) any glacier
in the world in a fully automated and extensible workflow. OGGM is **modular** and
supports novel modelling workflows: it loves to be remixed and reused! OGGM also brings together a
vibrant and friendly [community of scientists, modellers and educators](https://community.oggm.org){:target="_blank"}.

Please [get in touch](#get-involved) with us if you are interested in using
the model or if you'd like to contribute to the project!

## Mission

<p>
<center>
<i>
"Develop a <strong>global</strong> scale, <strong>modular</strong>, and
<strong>open source</strong> numerical model framework for <strong>consistently</strong>
simulating past and future global scale glacier change"
</i>
</center>
</p>

*Global* not only in the sense of leading to meaningful results for all
 glaciers combined, but also for any small ensemble of glaciers, e.g. at the
 headwater catchment scale. *Modular* to allow different approaches to the
 representation of ice flow and surface mass balance to be combined and
 compared against each other. *Open source* so that the code can be
 read and used by anyone and so that new modules can be added and discussed by
 the community, following the principles of transparency and open governance.
 *Consistent* in order to provide well-defined uncertainty measures at all
 realizable scales.

## Motivation

Our project is motivated by the far reaching goal of contributing
(and helping others to contribute) to answers of some of the
“big questions” in Earth Sciences:
- How much ice is stored on the glaciers on Earth?
- How much ice was present on Earth at the beginning of the 20th century, and how much ice will be lost by the end of the 21st?
- How will this affect water resources, and how to help communities to prepare for these changes?
- What are the uncertainties associated with these numbers, and where do they originate?
- How much model complexity is just right?
- and more.
